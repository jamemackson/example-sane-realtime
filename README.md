SANE Example on using Realtime socket.io connections
==========================
[HOW-To-Sane](http://github.com/mgenev/how-to-sane) is the official demo app of how to use the [SANE stack](https://github.com/artificialio/sane). It is also the main experiment laboratory for prototyping and spinning off sane add ons.

This project is a very simple example of setting up a basic realtime application.

This project implements a basic activity feed that is entirely driven based on the input form. Open the running project up in multiple browsers to view each connected client get updated with new activity messages when one is created in any of the clients.

read the document [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for more information on the project was created.

> note that docs/README.md still needs to be completed - currently just a stub.
